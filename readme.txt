Note is a simple and easy to use widget for editing bits of text, live, in your WordPress front-end Customizer.


== Description ==

Note is a simple and easy to use widget for editing bits of text, live, in your WordPress front-end Customizer. Add Notes into any sidebar to visualize how your copy will appear within the unique layout and design of your website.

Note was created so you could visualize the look & feel of your copy in the context of your website's design. The best way to experience Note is - do it live.
